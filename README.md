Bot that detects spam and posts links to it to chatrooms for quick deletion. 

Idea based of <a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector">smoke-detector</a> and done as a personnal's project. 

I wanted to add comments moderation, but as smoke-detector is done in python, while my expertise is c/c++. I did that port for that reason.

To be used on <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a>.

Code commit coming soon. (<b>Too instable at the moment</b>)
